# About

This is a stretch project for the lighthouse labs web development course. It uses HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery to render a barchart to a page. I have used bootstrap to simplify the component design and layout. The chart is code uses a revealing module pattern and string literals to create templated and re-usable classes in JS.

The project is for lighthouse labs web development bootcamp.
